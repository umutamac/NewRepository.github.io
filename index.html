        <p>Hello everyone! My name is Umut and I am currently on my way to become a Full-Stack Web Developer thanks to the coding bootcamp at UT Austin. I have recently earned a Bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering, however, during this shaky time in the job market,
            I've decided to dive into an industry which I had an interest in but no time for it previously.</p>

        <p>For some beackground information, I was born and raised in Istanbul, Turkey. I have gone to a French high school in Istanbul, then moved to USA to attend Penn State University.
            I had the chance to study an interesting subject and took part on many technical projects like building a gas-powered car as my capstone project, as well as lived in a foreing culture for several years, all of which I enjoyed every moment. 
            After finishing college and having a job-hunting period in the USA, I have come back to Istanbul.</p>

        <p>Currently, I am not certain about whether I will look for a job in web deelopment or in engineering after I am done with my coding bootcamp, but having multiple options is something very valuable for me. I'll see where future takes me...</p>
